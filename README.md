## Project Overview 🌟

This project is designed to detect spammers and fake IDs using a machine learning pipeline. The workflow includes:

- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features that are indicative of spammer and fake ID behaviors.
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to identify spammers and fake IDs.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing data and model results for better insights.
